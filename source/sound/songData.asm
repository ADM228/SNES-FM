;Song format description (in development):
	;2. New song data
	;   Is opcode-based.
	;   Opcodes:
	;       $00-$5F - Note (C0-B7)
	;       $60     - Set the instrument number high bits to 00,
	;       $61     -                                        01,
	;       $62     -                                        10,
	;       $63     -                                        11
	;       $64-$67 - Set instrument section to (opcode - $64)
	;       $68     - Disable attack
	;       $69 xx  - Set separate arpeggio table ($00 means none,
	;                   overrides the instruments arpeggio)
	;       $6A xx  - Same but with pitch 
	;       $6B xx  - Fine pitch (center is $80, $00 = -1 semitone, $FF â‰ˆ +1 semitone)
	;		$6C X Y	- Pitch slide (indefinitely long, 
	;					adds X to pitch index, Y to note number)
	;
	;       $6D-$6F - Not filled yet       
	;		Planned: portamento, vibrato,
	;
	;       $70 xx  - Set left volume
	;       $71 xx  - Set right volume
	;       $72 xx  - Set both volumes
	;       $73 X Y Z - Left volume slide
	;       $74 X Y Z - Right volume slide
	;       $75 X Y Z - Both volume slide
	;           (X - Step size whole part & sign,
	;            Y - Step size fractional part,
	;            Z - Target volume,
	;            1 byte each)
	;
	;       $76-$7B - Not filled yet
	;
	;       $7C     - Key off
	;       $7D X   - Repeat reference from X bytes ago (difference between
	;                   before the opcode and after the parameters of the 
	;                   Set reference opcode)
	;       $7E L ptr - Set reference (L = amount of waiting opcodes)
	;       $7F     - Loop
	
	;       $80-$FE - Wait opcode >> 1 frames
	;       $81-$FF - Set instrument to (high bits) | (opcode >> 1)
	;       
	;       with

	;2. Legacy song data
	;   e e {n [i] t} $FF
	;   n - Note
	;       rnnnnnnn
	;       r - Retrigger/change instrument
	;       nnnnnnn - Note number
	;       Special commands in note number:
	;       $FD - Do nothing and wait
	;       $FE - Key off and wait
	;       $FF - End of song data for this pattern
	;   [i] - Instrument number (if r is set)
	;   t - Time to wait until next note
