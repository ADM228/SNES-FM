========================= SNESFM TODO =========================
(no Genecyzer-related stuff)

[i] - semi-incoherent idea/concept, make more concrete
[ ] - idea coherent, not done
[p] - implementation in progress
[d] - implemented but undocumented
[D] - implemented; documentation in progress

- [d] Toggleable noise support
- [d] [d] Generate 7/8 and 15/16 tables on the fly
- [ ] Custom sample support:
    - [ ] Use sample addresses for that
        - [ ] ×4 pointer instead of ×2?
    - [i] Be able to specify loop and start addresses
        - Maybe via a flag to toggle whether to specify separately?
    - [i] Command to insert custom sample
- [i] Instrument pitchbend support
    - 1 byte or 2?
- [ ] Triangle and saw waves
    - [ ] Add option for simplified algorithm that only makes saw and triangle waves
        - [ ] Sawtooth: forward / reverse option
        - [ ] [ ] Triangle: shifted by ½ or not, inverted option (same bit as forward/reverse)
        - Generate 'em in a loop
    - [ ] Also make a complex algorithm that can make a tilted triangle wave as well
        - Something something $FF / count
            - Optimize to do it only once?
        - [ ] [ ] Able to be shifted by ½ and inverted
            - [ ] [ ] Make both configurable on compile time too?
- [ ] Phasemod feedback command
    - [ ] [ ] [ ] Specify 2 memory cells to be taken up, amount of iterations, and mod strength
    - [ ] Possibly specify the very source via a flag?
- [ ] Mult command
    - [i] Do it with fixed or floating point?
    - [ ] Be able to extend it across multiple cells
- [ ] Volume command
    - [ ] [ ] Both 8-bit and 16-bit signed
        - For 16-bit do the entire multiplication and take up as much dp as possible
        - [ ] [ ] Compile-time toggles for either
- [ ] Ringmod command
    - Basically volume but it gets the sample's value instead of 1 set value
    - Maybe self-modify volume routine
        - Automatically turns on the 16-bit one ofc
- [i] AND gate
    - Supply or generate bitmask? (like bitcrush)
    - Be able to AND samples?
        - Self mod code?
- [i] XOR gate?????
    - Definitely supply bitmask
    - Be able to XOR samples?
        - Self mod code?
- [i] 4 SECTIONS IN INSTRUMENTS
    - [ ] Effect to swap sections 
    - What happens when in progress?
- [i] Sound effects
- [i] Streaming samples
